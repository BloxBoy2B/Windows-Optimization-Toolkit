Welcome to the Windows Optimization Toolkit — a collection of safe, transparent PowerShell commands and registry tweaks designed to help you streamline Windows, remove unnecessary components, and boost overall performance — without the risks that come from using modified or pre-stripped ISOs.

⚙️ What This Repository Does

This toolkit focuses on custom, manual optimization, giving you full control over what stays and what goes:

🧼 Debloating Windows – Use PowerShell scripts to remove unnecessary default apps, background services, and features that slow down your system.

🧰 Registry Optimization – Apply hand-picked DWORD entries in the Registry Editor to disable unwanted telemetry, background tracking, and system bloat.

🧩 AppX Package Removal – Clean out hidden or pre-installed Windows AppX packages that normally can’t be removed through Settings.

🔒 Security-First Design – Since you’re executing the commands yourself, you avoid the malware risks that come with downloading unverified or “stripped-down” Windows ISOs.

🧠 Why Use This Repo

Unlike custom ISOs, this method ensures:

✅ Full Transparency – You see every command that runs.

✅ No Malware Risk – You’re not downloading a modified system image.

✅ Custom Control – Choose exactly what to keep or remove.

✅ System Integrity – Keeps Windows activation, updates, and stability intact.
